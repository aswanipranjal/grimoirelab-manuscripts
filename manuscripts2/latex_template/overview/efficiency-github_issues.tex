In order to provide some insight into the software development process of PROJECT-NAME community, several metrics on GitHub issues and pull requests are presented below. In terms of GitHub terminology, these metrics are calculated as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Backlog Management Index (BMI), measured as the number of closed tickets out of open tickets in a given period.
    \item Time to Close issues (TTC), the time since an issue was opened till this is closed.
\end{itemize}

    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|l}%
    \bfseries BMI & \bfseries TTC
    \csvreader[head to column names]{overview/efficiency.csv}{}% use head of csv as column names
    {\\\bmitickets & \daystocloseticketmedian ~ days}
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Closed out of opened issues (BMI), median time to close issues(TTC)}
